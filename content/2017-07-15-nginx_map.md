# How to Use Nginx's map Module.

Sometimes we need to redirect old URI of our web service to new URI, without changing our legacy frontend. I will walk you through Nginx's map Module that can be used to achieve our goal.

## Step 1 – Creating map file

Create file called uri_map at root folder (_/etc/nginx/uri_map_) of Nginx and fill it in with:

    :::text
    /old/uri1	/new/uri1;
    …
    /old/uriX	/new/uriX;

where two pars represent old and new URI, separated with TAB.

## Step 2 – Edit configuration file

Include following text at the top of your nginx.conf configuration file:
	
	:::text
	map $uri $new_uri {
   	    include /etc/nginx/uri_map;
    }

and following text to server block:
	
	:::text
    server {
        listen 80;
        server_name XXX;
        ...
        # Old static views redirect
        if ($new_uri) {
            rewrite ^ $new_uri permanent;
        }
        ...
    }


## Step 3 - Reload nginx

Use follwoing command to reload nginx configurations:

    :::sh
    $ sudo systemctl reload nginx.service

Check if redirection works with:

    :::sh
    $ curl -I domain.name.com/old/uri
    HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently
    Server: nginx/1.10.3
